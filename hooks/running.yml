- name: Installing Ansible from Agent component
  # NOTE(spredzy): While we are using Ricky's server we shouldn't
  # install anything. This playbook just verifies the workflow from
  # end-to-end. We need to create a new nodepool node where we can
  # actually pip install the ansible provided by DCI
  #pip:
  #  name: http://{{ agent_public_ip }}/{{ ansible_snapshot_to_test }}
  #  state: forceinstall
  command: echo 'Running'
